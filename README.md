#Word-Guess-Game

Welcome to Sage's Word Guessing Game 

Sage has created a thrilling game of hangman, and she wants to play with you! Keep in mind she is a dog, so she likes to do dog things. (Hint: That is the theme of her game).

Instructions: 
Press any letter key on your keyboard to begin guessing what Sage is thinking. 

Rules: 
The rules are simple. If you guess the word correctly before you run out of guesses, you win. If you guess incorrectly too many times, you lose. 

Good Luck!!!
